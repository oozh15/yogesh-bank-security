yogesh-bank-security
A security-focused banking web application built using PHP and React, demonstrating secure authentication, session management, and SQL injection prevention.


This project is developed using PHP as the main backend technology and React for the frontend. PHP handles user authentication, session management, and database operations using PDO prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. User passwords are securely stored using BCRYPT password hashing. PHP sessions are used to manage login state and OTP verification, with sensitive session data cleared after use. The application follows basic security best practices suitable for real-world web systems.

Backend: PHP (PDO, Sessions, Password Hashing)
Frontend: React
Database: MySQL
Security: SQL Injection Prevention, BCRYPT Hashing, OTP Sessions
